<h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
<p>Dear $variable1,</p>
<p>$variable1, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
<p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Travel Enthusiast $variable2</p>
